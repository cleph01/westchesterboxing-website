										<p>
											Life is one enormous ring. There is no escaping our opponents in life.   We can choose to face them, no matter what.  Yes, there will be fear, but fear can motivate us. It shines a light on our weaknesses that CAN be strenthened with hard work - and OUGHT to be.  The key is not to be AFRAID.  Being afraid is paralyzing.  It makes us imagine an outcome with no hope.
										</p>
										<p>
											Success in any endeavor in Life's ring, requires significant effort.  Make no mistake - we are either in a battle, coming out of a battle, or on our way to a battle.  Whether in our career, studies, relationships, sport, or against a bully - success boils down to how prepared we are for the fight; how disciplined we are 'outside of the ring'.
										</p>
										<p>
											Are we training the body, are we strengthening the mind, OR are we eating the wrong things and binge watching Rocky - wishing we had his heart?
										</p>
										<p>
											Discipline is often misunderstood.  We think of discipline and we think of punishment or revenge.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  Let's look at discipline through a new lens, one that reveals discipline for what it really is: freedom.
										</p>

										<blockquote>
											While Discipline and Freedom seem like they sit on opposite sides of the spectrum, they are actually very connected. Freedom is what everyone wants — to be able to act and live with freedom. But the only way to get to a place of freedom is through discipline. If you want financial freedom, you have to have financial discipline. If you want more free time, you have to follow a more disciplined time management system. You also have to have the discipline to say “No” to things that eat up your time with no payback—things like random YouTube videos, click-bait on the internet, and even events that you agree to attend when you know you won't want to be there. Discipline equals freedom applies to every aspect of life: if you want more freedom, get more discipline.
											
											<div>- Jacko Willink (Ret. Navy SEAL, Author)</div>
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											Discipline may not relieve us from the initial fear, but it does power us forward.  How? Because we have DONE the hard work, and we come prepared ready to do it again.
										</p>
										<p>
											Does discipline guarantee success?  Not always.  But it is the best recipe that human history can offer us.
										</p>
										<p>
											Yes, ok - so discipline holds the answer, which brings up the next question: "How long should we remain disciplined?  Where is the finish line?"  Like ultra athlete David Goggins (Ret. Navy SEAL, Author) likes to say, "It never ends, my friend!"
										<p>	
											Life is an un-ending series of challenges: those we can control and those we cannot.								
										</p>
										<p>
											It is a fool's endeavor to pray for life to be easier.  But it is godly to muster the WILL to become strong enough to endure a difficult one (Bruce Lee, Creator of Kung-Fu).
										</p>
										<p>
											Let us take-back charge of those things which we CAN control, namely the body, because a strong body will produce a powerful mind. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Confidence, self-esteem, and a unwavering WILL is the result of conscious physical discipline.
										</p>
										<blockquote>
											How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and [ignore the real reasons for not getting started].
											<div> 
												- Epictetus (Greek Stoic Philosopher circa. 100AD)
											</div>											
										</blockquote>
										<p>
											
											As Muhammad Ali mentions in the quote above, "Suffer [prepare] now and live the rest of your life as a Champion!"
										</p>	

										<p>
											We invite you to take full advantage of a free personal training boxing session.  Our training program will have a incredible impact on your physical wellbeing and on you mental strength.

											The personal attention from a W.B.C. trainer is what you deserve when meeting Life's challenges head-on.

											2020 is about leveling-up and it can't happen without you.
