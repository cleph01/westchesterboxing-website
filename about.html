                                            Our trainers face our proprietary WBC Trainer Certification Program before being hired.  The curriculum includes a boxing training foundation in addition to a communications benchmark.

                                        This is the empowering story of how the owner of Westchester Boxing Club took up the noble sport of boxing, saving his life.
                                        
                                        The discipline, diligence and committment to the sport became his foundation and drove him to become a successful business man and entrepreneur. 
                                        
                                        The Westchester Boxing Club is the result of his relentless perseverance.

                                    <p>
                                        Nick's life changed the day he collapsed in a gutter on his way to pick up his breakfast of beer and cigarettes.  He was homeless, unemployed, and dependent on drugs and alcohol.  Frequent trouble with the law seemed unavoidable for him at the time. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That day Nick picked himself up out of the gutter and made a decision that would change the course of his life.
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote> 
                                        I had a nervous breakdown that day when I was sitting in the gutter.  When I looked up, I saw "The Cage" and decided to go in.
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        “The Cage” was a former city and state funded boxing program on Ferris Avenue in White Plains.  Running the program was Maurice "Kid Sharkey" Sposato, 81, and retired boxer Kenny Mack Sr. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Nick credits Kid Sharkey with helping him turn his life around.

                                        Boxing redirected Nick's energy in a positive direction and helped him get back on his feet and hold down a job.

                                        Today, Nick is a healthy and successful business owner because of the values he earned in "The Cage" under the guidance of Kid Sharkey.

                                    <p>
                                        The Cage's funding was cut and Kid Sharkey had to shut its doors after 40 years of enriching the lives of countless young men.  
                                    </p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        The boxing program was the best program in the teen center and I was angry that they closed it down. I’m alive because of that program.
                                    </blockquote>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        Vowing to continue the life changing work Kid Sharkey began, Nick heroically took on the challenge to open his own boxing gym.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        His first facility was located in Mount Vernon, NY.  To fund the gym, he worked at a gasoline station from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. and opened his gym from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  He managed this tremendous work load for a year, but the long hours eventually took their toll and his body gave out. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        After recovering, Nick continued building his brand of endurance-training by working with local sports clubs as a boxing and aerobics instructor.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Throughout this time, Nick persisted in funding Westchester Boxing Club, doing what he needed to do despite being overlooked for a bank loan.
                                    </p> 

                                    <blockquote>
                                        I just did what I had to do to keep it going. There were a lot of times I couldn’t eat.
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>
                                        Initially, he funneled almost every penny of profit back into the business, allowing him to purchase weight training equipment and a $30,000 regulation size boxing ring.  
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>The Death of a Mentor, The Blessing on an Angel</h5>
                                    <p> 
                                        When his friend and mentor, Kenny Mack, Sr, died Nick was forced to re-learn how to cope with tragedy in a new and positive way.  The dragon of his old, destructive coping habits reered its ugly head - and Nick was forced into battle again with his old self.
                                    </p>

                                    <blockquote>
                                        I felt like just going out and getting drunk, but I remembered that we made that pact for life and I was still alive.
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p> 
                                        So, Nick doubled-down and used that pain as productive energy.  Despite lacking any formal business training, he moved hard and fast to expand Westchester Boxing Club and it began to grow.  Its membership was a diverse and dynamic crowd. 
                                    </p>

                                    <blockquote>

                                    <p>
                                        The gym grew to 320 members and the revenue from membership dues, personal training, and merchandise/nutrition started to surpass expenses.

                                        With Sposato as head trainer of his new Yonkers facility, Nick began promoting the benefits of the gym, which attracted more people who were looking for an alternative style of exercise.

                                        Fitness boxing is also a great aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise gets your heart pumping and helps lower the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can strengthen bones and muscles, burn more calories, and lift mood. Aerobics can also boost your endurance, which helps you climb a flight of stairs or walk farther.

                                        Traditional aerobics instructors began taking notice of the benefits and started incorporating boxing training into their own personal fitness routines.

                                        Boxing sharpens self-defense moves.  If you’re just 'watching' a class, it may not 'look' like you’re getting a hard workout, but when you’re doing it, you definitely feel it.  The fast combinations really get your heart rate up.

                                    <p>
                                        A boxer since 1932, Maurice "Kid Sharkey" Sposato is a legend in his own right.  He said his ringside name of “Kid Sharkey” was a spinoff of Tom Sharkey, “a boxer in the old days."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to contributing to the lives of countless young boxers, he also fought Sugar Ray Robinson to a draw back in 1939.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Already in his 80s, "the Kid" didn't let his age get in the way of his job as head trainer.  He might have taken a little longer to get there, but Sposato  still climbed into the ring to demonstrate the combinations and technique that helped many young men become champions. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Over the years he has worked with Carl “The Truth” Williams, Larry Holmes, Buster Davis, Cleo Daniels, Jose Torres and Lou Savarese.

                                        Sposato’s picture in his boxing heydays now graces the walls of "The Boxing Connection", along with those of “Boom Boom" Lenny Mancini, Jerry Quarry and Muhammad Ali.

                                    <p>
                                        "Kid Sharkey" passed away in 2016 at the age of 91.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Nick will forever feel lucky to have had Sposato with him, guiding him, and mentoring him all those years. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As a karmic duty to the man who helped him change his life, Nick actively participates in local charitable efforts that benefit children.  He often organizes bus trips to boxing events and offers disadvantaged youths a chance to learn boxing in exchange for helping out the gym.
