                                    <div class="box" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        <p>Some or more of these may or may not pertain to one or more of the other clubs</p>
                                        <p>The information below is full of reasons why we are the Oldest Independently Owned And The Best Boxing gym in Westchester, NY.</p>
                                        <p>We are independently owned and NOT a franchise. Why is this important? Franchises have large monthly fees in addition to the monthly dues. Since we are not a franchise, we can bring you a fair pricing structure. As well, you are able to speak to the owner directly if you have any questions or concerns. Nick and helpful staff are always ready to meet your needs. There are NO fake sales pitches that lock you into a contract with a ton of fees. Here you only pay for your actual training sessions, in which you get the unpided attention of each and any trainer you will be training with. NO overcrowded classes, NO sharing of gloves, and NO undisclosed fees</p>
                                        <p>Buyers Beware*</p>

                            <!-- UFC Gym/LA Boxing -->
                                <h2>UFC Gym/LA Boxing</h2>
                                <div class="box">
                                    <p>UFC Gym/LA Boxing has an Initiation Fee, but they do not disclose the COST of their initiation fee.
                                        You are required to pay Recurring Dues and Taxes in advance!
                                        UFC charges the following: Enrollment Fee, Processing Fee, Monthly Dues
                                        First and last month dues paid up front
                                        You are locked into an open ended contract
                                        They also charge you a Termination Fee, even if you're just changing your residency! It is $100 if half of your membership contract has not been completed, $50 if you have completed half of your membership.
                                        They also charge you $15 if you lose your membership card! After all of the fees and membership you have already paid for, would you want to be charged for a mistake? They also charge the same amount for a Late Fee.
                                        UFC Gym will also charge you $20 if you don't show up to a session or even cancel an hour before!
                                    </p>
                                    
                                        <p>Info can be found in their “Membership Policies” section </p>
                                </div>

                                <h2>​Westchester Fight Club</h2>
                                <div class="box">
                                    <p>The Westchester Fight Club offers you a 30 day free-trial but do not disclose exactly what you're getting in your 30 day free-trial. They DO NOT tell you anything you want to know about prices on their website! What is there to hide?
                                        *It's VERY IMPORTANT to know what you are getting yourself into before you agree to sign up for any membership! Here at Westchester Boxing Club we DO NOT hide anything from you!</p>
                                </div>

                            <!-- Title Boxing Club -->
                                <h2>Title Boxing Club</h2>
                                <div class="box">
                                    <p>Title Boxing Club is another franchise, that tends to hide all the information you need to know about prices.
                                        They trap you into a free session and then try to force you into a contract with a whole bunch of hidden fees that you don't need. This includes Enrollment Fees, Initiation Fees, Late Fees, Processing Fees, Termination Fees Monthly Dues, First and Last Month dues paid up front! Why Bother?
                                        At Title Boxing you are locked into an open ended contract
                                        You will also face problems of overcrowded classes, so there is a possibility that you won't have your own heavy bag. You may have to share one heavy back with 2 other people, which may cause an INJURY They also show their unhygienic ways into have people share the SAME boxing gloves! This is unethical!
                                        Don't be fooled by Title Boxing Club's offer of community gloves, which is absolutely disgusting! They have people use the same gloves as other people who have just had their sweaty hands in your gloves! This causes a potential buildup of mold and fungus inside of gloves!
                                        We WILL NOT tolerate this unsanitary action. Everyone is entitled to their own gloves, and extra long hand-wrap that for extra protection under your gloves. Both may be purchased any time at the Westchester Boxing Club!</p>
